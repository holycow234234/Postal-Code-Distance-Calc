# Postal-Code-Distance-Calc
***Depends on [JSON-Java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)***
I wrote this application a few years ago to automate some data entry I was doing. I needed to find the distance of some people to a particular place, some of whom do not have year round road access. This program was my answer to that problem.
###My implementations of JSON-Java and the Google Maps API may no longer be correct!
